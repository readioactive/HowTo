<h2 style="color:#ee82ee"><i> Step One: Find A Camera</i>  </h2>
<p>If you want to take a picture of anything you want to use a camera. Any camera will work, whether it be an old, vintage instant camera or a state-of-the-art DSLR camera. The type of camera most people have and use is their cell phone camera since it is convenient.<br>Here is a list of different types of cameras:</p><ul style= "list-style-type:square">
  <li><b>DSLR:</b> The camera that most professionals or people who are very serious about photography use. They're expensive and can take high-quality shots.</li>
  <li><b>Point and Shoot:</b> A small, compact camera. This type of camera is popular with tourists who don't want to carry a DSLR around with them but still want to take some good pictures or older people who don't need to learn all the fancy gadgets on a DSLR and need something simple, where you just 'Point and Shoot'.</li>
  <li><b>Instant Film: </b>This is the type of camera that Polaroids are. You take a photo and the camera will produce a picture within seconds. They were popular when they were first released, dipped low in popularity for awhile, but as of recent resurged with the younger generation. They're a fun way to take pictures, but film is expensive.</li>
  <li><b>iPhones/cell phones:</b> These types of cameras are probably the most convenient and most popular. Just about everyone, even my grandparents, have smartphones that they carry around with them wherever they go. It's so simple to just whip your phone out and take a quick snap of anything you see. The only flaw in this is that the camera quality is nothing compared to a DSLR or even some point and shoots, but it's improving with every new release.</li></ul>
<h3 style="color:#ee82ee"><i>Step Two: Learn How to Use It </i></h3>
<p>It's important to be familiar with your camera if you want to take a picture. Attempting to use a camera that you don't know anything about it, it may be close to impossible to take a picture. You should read the instructions to learn how to use whatever camera you have and all the features that come with it. This may take minutes, hours, days, or even months to master, but with persistence (and maybe a little help from some knowledgable friends) anyone can do it!</p>
<h3 style="color:#ee82ee"><i>Step Three: Take a Picture!</i></h3>
<p>By now, you should be the master of the camera you're using, so go out and take a picture of something! Take a walk, hang out with friends, it doesn't matter where you are or what you're doing or what you're taking a picture of. Just press the button and have fun with your pictures!</p>

<h2 style="color:#3cb371">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Photography is a fun hobby that can really get you involved with the world around you. God has created such a beautiful world, that we should take as many pictures as we can to appreciate what we have here! I hope you've learned a little bit on taking pictures from reading this!</p>
